# Profile Photo Instructions

## Photo Placeholder

The file `profile-placeholder.jpg` should be placed in this directory. This is where you should add your personal photo to be displayed in the About section.

## Recommended Photo Specifications

- **Dimensions**: Ideally 400x400px or larger with a 1:1 ratio (square)
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading
- **Style**: A professional headshot works best
- **Background**: A simple or neutral background will work well with the sci-fi theme

## Adding Your Photo

1. Replace the `profile-placeholder.jpg` file with your own photo
2. Make sure to keep the filename the same, or update the reference in the HTML
3. The photo will automatically be styled with the sci-fi frame and effects

## If No Photo is Available

If you don't have a photo to use, you can keep the placeholder or use any of these options:

1. Use a silhouette or avatar image
2. Use a professional logo
3. Create a sci-fi themed avatar

The photo frame is designed to work with any square image and will add futuristic styling to match the rest of the portfolio.
